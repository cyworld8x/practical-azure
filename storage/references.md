**What is Azure Storage?**
--------------------------

*   Microsoft's cloud storage solution for various data storage needs.
    
*   Offers object storage, file system service, messaging store, and NoSQL store.
    
*   Used for applications, virtual machines, and cloud services.
    

**Types of Data Stored in Azure Storage:**

*   **Virtual Machine Data:** Disks and files (managed disks, data disks) for virtual machines.
    
*   **Unstructured Data:** Non-relational data like website content or application code (Blob Storage, Data Lake Storage).
    
*   **Structured Data:** Data with a defined schema like database tables (Table Storage, Cosmos DB, SQL Database).
    

**Storage Account Tiers:**

*   **General Purpose:** Standard (HDD) for cost-effective bulk storage or infrequently accessed data. Premium (SSD) for low-latency performance for applications like databases.
    

**Key Considerations for Using Azure Storage:**

*   **Durability and Availability:** Data redundancy and replication for disaster recovery.
    
*   **Secure Access:** Encryption and access control mechanisms.
    
*   **Scalability:** Designed to handle massive data storage and performance needs.
    
*   **Manageability:** Microsoft manages infrastructure and maintenance.
    
*   **Data Accessibility:** Accessible globally over HTTP/HTTPS with SDKs and scripting options. Easy management through portal, Storage Explorer, and command-line tools.

**Azure Container**:

*   A container organizes a set of **blobs** (similar to a directory in a file system).
    
*   Each storage account can have an unlimited number of containers.
    
*   Containers store unstructured data, such as media, content, or application data.
    
*   To create a container, follow these steps:
    
    *   In the Azure portal, navigate to your storage account.
        
    *   Go to the **Containers** section and create a new container with a unique name.
        
    *   Set the access level (recommended: **Private**).
        
*   [Containers are essential for organizing and managing blob data](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/blob-containers-portal)[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/blob-containers-portal).
    
**File Shares (Azure Files)**:

*   File shares provide **SMB-based file storage** in Azure.
    
*   You can create file shares within a **FileStorage account** (dedicated to Azure file shares only).
    
*   File shares are accessible via standard file protocols (SMB/CIFS) and can be mounted by VMs or on-premises systems.
    
*   Useful for sharing files across VMs or applications.
    
*   [No other storage resources (like blobs, queues, or tables) can be deployed in a FileStorage account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/blob-containers-portal)[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-how-to-create-file-share).
    
**Queues**:

*   Azure Queues provide a **messaging store** for reliable communication between application components.
    
*   Ideal for asynchronous communication and decoupling components.
    
*   Use cases include task scheduling, logging, and event-driven processing.
    
*   Queues support **FIFO (first-in, first-out)** message processing.
    
*   [Messages are stored in a queue until processed by a consumer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/blob-containers-portal)[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/blob-containers-portal).
    
**Tables**:

*   Azure Tables offer a **NoSQL store** for schemaless storage of structured data.
    
*   Designed for fast querying and scalability.
    
*   Use cases include storing large amounts of semi-structured data (like logs or sensor data).
    
*   Tables support partitioning, indexing, and querying by primary key.
    
*   [Not suitable for complex relational data; best for simple key-value pairs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/blob-containers-portal)[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/blob-containers-portal).
AzCopy**:
    
*   **Purpose**: AzCopy is a command-line tool for scripted and programmatic data transfer.
    
*   **Functionality**:
    
    *   Allows easy copying of data to and from Azure Blob Storage, Azure File Storage, and Azure Table Storage.
        
    *   Supports concurrency, parallelism, and resuming copy operations.
        
    *   Can also copy data from AWS to Azure.
        
*   **Use Cases**:
    
    *   Bulk data transfer between various Azure storage types.
        
    *   Ideal for moving files quickly.
        
*   [**Performance**: Offers optimal performance for data movement](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/data-guide/scenarios/data-transfer)[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/data-guide/scenarios/data-transfer)[2](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-azcopy).
        
**Azure Data Disk**:
    
*   **Purpose**: Azure Data Disk provides block-level storage volumes for Azure virtual machines (VMs).
    
*   **Advantages**:
    
    *   **Highly Durable and Available**: Achieves 99.999% availability with three replicas of data.
        
    *   **Scalable**: Supports up to 50,000 VM disks per subscription per region.
        
    *   **Integration with Availability Sets**: Works seamlessly with availability sets for VM redundancy.
        
*   **Use Cases**:
    
    *   VM storage needs, including IaaS VMs.
        
    *   Ensuring data safety during transient hardware failures.
        
*   **Supported Disk Types**:
    
    *   [Standard HDD, Standard SSD, Premium SSD, Ultra SSD, and Performance Plus (preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-types)[3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-types).
